    Download                 This will allow editing of des3 encrypted files. The file must have .des3 extension. The "openssl" command line tool must be in the path. This will turn off the swap file and .viminfo log.

                             You can start by editing an empty unencrypted file with a .des3 extension. When you first write the file you will be asked to give it a password.

                             If you edit any file named .auth.des3 (full name, not just the extension) then this plugin will add folding features and an automatic quit timeout. You can see an animated GIF screenshot here:

                             Vim will quit automatically after 5 minutes of no typing activity (unless the file has been changed).

                             This plugin will fold on wiki-style headlines with the following form:
                                  == This is a headline ==
                             Any notes under the headline will be inside the fold until the next headline is reached. The SPACE key will toggle a fold open and closed. The q key will quit Vim.

                             Create the following example file named ~/.auth.des3:
                                  == Colo server ==
                                  username: maryjane
                                  password: esydpm
                                  == Office server ==
                                  username: peter
                                  password: 4m4z1ng

                             Then create a bash alias:

                                  alias auth='view ~/.auth.des3'

                             Now you can view your password safe by typing "auth". When Vim starts all the password information will be hidden under the headlines. To view the password information put the cursor on the headline and
                             press SPACE.

                             Thanks to Tom Purl for the des3 tip.

                             install details
                             Put this in your plugin directory and Vim will automatically load it:

                                 ~/.vim/plugin/des3.vim

                             You can also source it directly from your .vimrc file:

                                 source des3.vim
