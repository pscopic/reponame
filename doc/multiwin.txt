2. MultiWin Manual											*multiwin*

This plugin tries to replicate the command line option '-o' and forces the
active window to use as many lines as it can, while forcing inactive windows
to show one 1 line (the statusline).

Once VIM is opened with more than one file, you'll be able to navigate between
windows by clicking on their respective statusline.  This will maximize the
window and minimize all others.  You can also use Alt-Left and Alt-Right to
flip back and forth between windows (unless you have disabled it |multiwin-var|).
In the command line (vim.exe), it will use Ctrl-Left and Ctrl-Right, since
the command line vim cannot intercept alt-key strokes.

Quickfix windows will be held at a height of 10 lines.  This can be changed by
q:multiwin_qfh |multiwin-var|.

Be sure to use |:new| or |:split| to open new windows, as using |:e| will just
change the buffer in the current window.  MultiWin also reacts to files dragged
and dropped on Vim and opened via the Explorer context menu's "Edit with
existing Vim" command.

If VIM is in compatible mode or in diff mode, MultiWin will not load.
